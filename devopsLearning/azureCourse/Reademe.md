## What is cloud computing
        The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store,
        manage and process data,rather than a local server or a personal computer

            On-Premise                      Cloud Providers
        1) You own the servers              Someone else owns the server
        2) you hire the IT people           Someone else hire the IT people
        3) you pay or rent the real-state   Someone else pays or rent the real state
        4) you take all the risk            You are responsible for configuring the cloud 
                                            service and code,someone else take care of the rest
    
## Trends towards cloud computing from pyhsical 
        1) Dedicated Server: 
            One physical machine dedicated to single a business.Run a single web-app/site
                **Very Expensive,High Maintainence,High Security
        2) Virtual Private Server:
                 One physical machine dedicated to a single business.The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines.
                 Run multiple web-app/pages
        3) Shared Hosting:
                One physical machine,shared by hunderd of businessess.Relies
                on most tenants under-utilizing their resource.
                **Very cheap,Very Limited
        4) Cloud Hosting:
                Multiple physical machines that act as one system.The system
                is abstracted into multiple cloud services
                ** Flexible,Scalable,Secure,Cost-Effective,High Configurability

## Common Cloud Services:
        A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped various type of services.
        The four most common types of cloud services for IAAS would be:
            a) Compute:
                Imagine haveing a virtual machine that can run application,program and code
            b) Storage:
                Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files
            c) Networking:
                Imagine that a virtual network being able to define internet 
                connections or network isolations
            d) Database:
                Imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application

## What is Azure?
    Microsoft calls their cloud provider service
        Microsof Azure
        Commonly refered to as AZURE
## Benefits of cloud computing
1) Cost-Effective:
    You **pay for what you come**, no up-front cost.Pay-as-you-go(PAYG) thoushands of customers sharing the cost of the resources
2) Global
    Launch workloads **anywhere in the world**,Just choose a region
3) Secure
    Cloud providers take care of physical security.**Cloud services can by secure by default** or you have the ability to configure access down to granualr level
4) Reliable:
    data backup,disaster recovery, and data replication and fault tolerence
5) Scalable:
    Increase or decrease resoruces and services based on demand
6) Elastic:
    Automate scaling during spike and drop in demand
7) Current:
    The underlying hardware and managed software is patched,upgraded and replaced by the cloud provider without interruption to you
